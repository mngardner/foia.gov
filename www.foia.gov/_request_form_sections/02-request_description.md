The description of the records you are requesting is important. The scope
of your request can impact how quickly an agency can respond to your
request. Your description should be as  clear and specific as possible
and must give agency FOIA personnel enough detail so that they are able to reasonably
determine exactly which records are being requested and where to locate
them.
