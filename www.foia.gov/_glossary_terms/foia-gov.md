FOIA.gov is the governmentâ€™s comprehensive website about the FOIA.  Among many other features, FOIA.gov provides a central resource for the public to learn about the FOIA, to locate records that are already available online, and to make a request for information that is not yet publicly available.  Requesters can make a request to any agency subject to the FOIA using FOIA.gov. FOIA.gov also promotes agency accountability for the administration of the FOIA by graphically displaying the detailed statistics contained in agency Annual FOIA Reports, so that they can be compared by agency and over time.
